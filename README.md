# Darkmode in next 13 using styled-components

This project demonstrates how to possibly implement a dark mode using styled-components and use-local-storage-state in a next.js 13 environment.

## These are the iterations

### 1. ThemeProvider approach

- [x] switches between light and dark theme
- [ ] preferred scheme respected
- [ ] decision remembered
- [x] works with server-side rendering

### 3. Remember user decision

### 4. Work server-side

> ðŸ’¡ Not quite sure about this approach yet. Wrote a custom hook `useDunkel` that stores darkMode decisions in cookies, which can be accessed via getServerSideProps for that "no flicker" approach. Still work in progress.
