# Darkmode in next 13 using styled-components

This project demonstrates how to possibly implement a dark mode using styled-components and use-local-storage-state in a next.js 13 environment.

---

## Approach

In our GlobalStyle component, we define the color variables using CSS custom properties within the :root selector, and we use an if-else statement that depends on the darkMode prop to determine which theme to use - either the light or dark theme defined in the theme object.

In our Styled Components, we exclusively use CSS variables for colors.
